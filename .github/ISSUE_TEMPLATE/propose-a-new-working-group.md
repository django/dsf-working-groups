*You'll need all the following info for a proposal to be considered complete. See the README for more information on each field.*

**Name**: what will you call your WG?

**Scope of responsibilities**:

Write a paragraph or a few bullet points describing the WG here. 
- What powers are you asking the board to delegate to you?
- What actions are you proposing the WG be allowed to take directly?
- Which actions will the WG take back to the Board for votes?

**Initial membership**:

- Chair: 
- Co-Chair:
- Board Liaison (must be an active Board member; may be the same as Chair/Co-Char): 
- Other members:

**Future membership**:

How will decisions on adding/removing members be handled? 

We suggest picking one of the following:

- Direct membership: new members may self-nominate; the WG will vote (50%+1) to approve/deny new members; the WG will directly vote on new Chair/Co-Chairs. (This is the appropriate model for most WGs).
- Board-managed: new members may self-nominate, but must be voted in by the Board. The Board must approve changes to the Chair/Co-Chair. (This is the appropriate model for sensitive WGs, such as the Conduct WG, or WGs with large budgets ($thousands/year).)

**Budget**: how much money or spending discretion do you need?

**Where will discussions and activities take place?**

Suggestion: a mailing list that we'll create, `this-cool-wg@djangoproject.com`

Meetings: we suggest synchronous meetings via Meet/Zoom/Whereby/etc at least monthly.

**Reporting** - how and how often will the WG report back to the board?

Suggestion: we'll email a written report to the board [monthly/every two months/every quarter].
