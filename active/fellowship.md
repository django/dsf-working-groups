# Fellowship Working Group

## Scope of responsibilities

The Fellowship Working Group manages the [Django Fellowship Program](https://www.djangoproject.com/fundraising/#fellowship-program). This includes:

- Interviewing candidates for open Fellowship slots and making hiring recommendations to the Board. This includes developing and maintaining interview and selection scripts, exercises, and rubrics.
- Acting as an HR committee for Fellows. In the event of a complaint about a Fellow, or if there are performance issues, the Fellowship-WG will investigate, in concert with the [Code of Conduct WG](code-of-conduct.md) if necessary, and present findings and a recommendation to the board for action.
  - As with the CoC-WG, the Fellowing-WG has the power to unilaterally suspend Fellows, with pay, pending an investigation. This power should only be used in egregious circumstances, where waiting on investigation and/or board action might plausibly be harmful.
- Designating one member of the committee to act as the line manager for active fellows.
  - The Board must approve this designation.
  - Defining what it means to be a manager is out of scope for this document, but it's all the typical stuff: one-on-ones, feedback, coaching, and performance management, if necessary.
  - It's expected that this person will have previous engineering management experience.
  - This person also approves expenses for Fellows, subject to the [budget](#budget), see below.
  - Perform bi-annual performance reviews for the fellows, and reports to the board.
    - This can be super informal, short and sweet is fine. This is intended to be a backstop against the unlikely event of performance issues with a fellow, not any sort of stack ranking etc.
- Acting as an escalation point if a Fellow has a disagreement with their designated manager. That is, the escalation path for Fellows is: designated manager -> full Fellowship WG -> Board.
- Maintaining the formal job description and outline of duties for Fellows. Those changes must be reported to the Board who may veto them by board vote.
- Gathering and maintaining statistics on the impact and efficacy of the Fellow program (for use in fundraising, reports to sponsors, etc). See [reporting](#reporting) for a short discussion of this report.
- TKTK am I missing anything?

## Initial membership

Upon adoption of this new charter, the Board will issue an open call for members, recruit, and select membership. We'll follow the guidelines outlined below under [future membership](#future-membership) in selecting this initial group./

- Chair: TBD
- Board liaison: TBD
- Designated manager: TBD
- Other members:
  - TBD

## Future membership

Board-managed: the DSF Board appoints members of this WG, including specific roles (chair, Fellow manager).

The Board will select membership with some high-level goals in mind:

- **Diversity**: the WG membership should be diverse, as representative of the global Django community as possible within the confines of a small team.
- **Management experience**: WG members, _particularly_ the designated manager, should have some engineering management experience, or other relevant experience (i.e. experience with fellowship programs at other NPOs, etc). This isn't a hard

Membership is open to volunteers, subject to board approval. [Contact the board](https://www.djangoproject.com/contact/foundation/) to express interest. Please include a brief explanation of how your background aligns with the goals above.

## Budget

- The Board sets the Fellowship compensation (which is adjusted yearly, automatically, to match CPI inflation).
- The Board establishes a yearly Travel & Expenses budget, which Fellows may spend against (with management approval). This is set to a level to allow Fellows to attend at least one DjangoCon.
  - Expenses beyond this yearly budget may (probably will!) be approved, but would require approval by the board to increase the budget.

## Comms

The Fellowship-WG has a private mailing list, and uses the DSF Slack.

## Reporting

The Fellowship WG is required to submit two kinds of reports:

- A report on the impact and efficacy of the Fellow program.
  - The specifics of what needs to be in here is up to the Fellowship WG, but probably should include things like count of tickets triaged and PRs reviewed, along with more qualitivave info like highlights of major features reviewed/shepherded, mentorship of new/existing contributors, talks at conferences, etc.
  - Frequency: at least quarterly, with a strong preference for some sort of live "dashboard" (read: Google Sheet) that's updated more regularly for the Board to check any time.
- A bi-annual performance review for each Fellow. See above under [scope of responsibilities](#scope-of-responsibilities) for a brief explanation.
