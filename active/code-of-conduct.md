# Code of Conduct Working Group

## Scope of responsibilities

The Code of Conduct WG handles reports of violations to the [Django Code of Conduct](https://djangoproject.com/conduct).

See https://github.com/django/code-of-conduct for full details.

## Membership

- Chair: Brian Moloney
- Board Liaison: DSF President (currently Chaim Kirby)
- Other members:
  - Jeff Triplett
  - Olumide Bakare
  - Joseph V. Cardenas
  - Michael Clark
  - Tibbs Hefflin

## Future membership

Self-managed: volunteers are screened and inducted by the current WG membership. The membership likewise elects its own chair (via 50%+ voting). See https://github.com/django/code-of-conduct/blob/main/membership.md for more details.

The DSF President is always a member of the CoC WG, and its board liaison.

## Budget

The CoC-WG has no directly appropriated budget.

## Comms

See https://github.com/django/code-of-conduct/blob/main/communications.md

## Reporting

The DSF President (aka Board Liaison), will be responsible for formal reporting back to the board. This is an as-needed reporting structure: the President will report on activities as they are relevant to the board, which may mean no reports if nothing is happening.

Additionally, the CoC-WG will publish its own public reports, including a transparency report. See https://github.com/django/code-of-conduct/blob/main/transparency.md and https://github.com/django/code-of-conduct/blob/main/statistics.md.
