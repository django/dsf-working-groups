# Online Community Working Group

## Scope of responsibilities

This group exists to support the official community platforms and those in elevated roles on those platforms.

The [Django Forum](https://forum.djangoproject.com/) and the [Django Discord](https://discord.gg/xcRH6mN4fa) are core parts of the overall community and those that help and moderate these platforms take significant time from their day to help others.
We can support them through training and taking action to make their lives easier.

The broad goals of the group are:
  - facilitate and centralise discussion between moderators and admins on the various platforms
  - coordinate efforts for training and processes around moderation
  - provide support to improve the platforms to lighten moderation and admin workloads
  - provide training and support to the wider community on how to use the platforms effectively
  - ensure consistency that our online Django communities are welcoming and safe spaces

- What actions are you proposing the WG be allowed to take directly?
  - Creation and management of processes related to community platforms. Examples of these processes include
    - Proposals for adding/removing moderators & other roles and the adding/removing of roles directly
    - Training for moderators & other roles as required
    - Ensuring moderation is consistent across teams and platforms
  - Taking ideas from the community to improve the community spaces.

- Which actions will the WG take back to the Board for votes?
  - Proposal to trial a new platform
  - Proposal to migrate to a new platform
  - Proposal to retire an existing platform that is in use
  - Budget to improve existing platforms

There is a lot of potential ideas in this space. Part of the WG will be setting up a process to take ideas and have a backlog of these ideas.

### Delegated responsibilities

With regards to Django Software Foundation responsibilities and resources, the group operates with:

- A minimum of two members having admin privileges for a single platform while a single member of the group not having admin priveleges to all platforms.

## Initial membership

- Chair: Andrew Miller
- Co-Chair: TBD
- Board Liaison (must be an active Board member; may be the same as Chair/Co-Chair): Tom Carrick?
- Other members:
  - Patryk Bratkowski

## Future membership

- Who is eligible to join? Any volunteer, or are there specific requirements?
  - Anyone can join, however they need to active on the community platforms for at least 3 months or nominated by a DSF Individual member.
- How do people who want to join sign up / volunteer / express interest?
  - Send one of the WG members a message on Discord or the Forum
- How will decisions on adding/removing members be handled?
  - New members may self-nominate.
  - Members will serve for a one year term. At the end of this term, they need to opt into staying involved to keep being a member of the group.
  - New members will get approved by existing members of the WG.
  - If any member wishes to leave the group before the end of their term, they can do so by notifying the group.
  - Members can propose a vote on removing a member from the working group. This needs 50%+1 agreement.

## Budget

- How much money or spending discretion do you need?
  - None to begin with, however I would expect over time budget might get requested for supporting the Forum and Discord server. See below for [ideas](#budget-ideas)
- How do you want that money allocated:
  - None to begin with.

## Comms

Where will discussions and activities take place?

Suggestions:

- Private Channel in the Discord Server and private category in the forum, possibly also a channel is the DSF slack.
- This space should be shared with the CoC Commitee or another space for shared comms across platforms.

Meetings: Quarterly video call meeting on Discord.

## Reporting

How and how often will the WG report back to the board?
  - Quarterly forum post and discord announcement of improvements made to the platforms.
  - Private quarterly report of improvements made to the platforms to the Board
