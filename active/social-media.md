# Social Media Working Group

## Scope of responsibilities

This working group will manage Django's official social media profiles on behalf of the Django Software Foundation.

The goals of the group are:
- Promote the use of Django among the World Wide Web development community.
- Protect the framework's long-term viability through campaigns and sponsor relations.
- Ensure the DSF’s Code of Conduct is maintained on its media channels.
- Assist the board in posting official news and updates from the DSF.

The group opts to manage platforms that best achieve these goals.
This may be a subset of those for which Django has accounts.

Delegated responsibilities:
- The Chair, Co-Chair and Board Liaison can grant access to Django's official social media profiles to other group 
  members as needed.
- Members can post content to Django's official social media profiles, in alignment with the working group's agreed 
  goals, without a board review.
- Members can perform actions such as “like”, “repost” or “comment” as Django, when it aligns with the working group's 
  agreed goals, without a board review.
- Members can perform maintenance and monitor the automations which post DSF news and updates to social media channels.
- Members can enforce the Code of Conduct. This may include moderating comments that do not meet our CoC or blocking 
  users that grossly or repeatedly violate the CoC.

Actions to take back to the DSF Board for votes:
- Amendments to the working group's goals.
- Approval on content that is outside the agreed group's goals.
- Proposals of social media campaigns for our sponsors.
- Proposal to have a new social media profile on a platform.
- Proposal to retire a social media profile from a platform.

## Initial membership

## Future membership

### Who is eligible to join? Any volunteer, or are there specific requirements?

Members must have demonstrable experience with social media platforms, and be registered as a Django Software Foundation
Individual Member.

### How do people who want to join sign up / volunteer / express interest?

A form will be made available in a public space (once created this will be linked to here also).

This form will include questions confirming:
- their DSF membership
- why they want to join
- what experience and skills they bring to the role
- links to their social media profiles

### How will decisions on adding/removing members be handled?

The working group will discuss and vote (50%+1) to approve new members.

Members join the group for a 6-month term. At the end of this term, they need to opt into staying involved to keep being 
a member of the group.

If any member wishes to leave the group before the end of their term, they can do so without a vote.

Members can propose a vote on removing a member from the working group. This needs 50%+1 agreement.

## Budget

The working group will have no allocated budget.

## Comms within the group

- Fortnightly synchronous meeting
- Collaborative documents when creating a content plan and/our campaign
- Private channel in the DSF slack

## Reporting

We'll email a written report to the board every quarter.
