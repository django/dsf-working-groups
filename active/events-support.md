## Future membership

Membership is open to community members who are interested in supporting Django events. While experience organizing Django conferences and events is valuable, it is not strictly required. We’re looking for members with diverse backgrounds and experiences, that can respond to the needs of event organizers worldwide.

- Members join the group for a term of 12 months. At the end of this term, they need to opt into staying involved to keep being a member of the group.
- Individuals can self-nominate with the [Events Support Working Group application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeq_kbsnvvTW2Tkk1cUsCOk3CJNoBbT7HANM6ZUo8t38PieLQ/viewform?usp=dialog).
- Membership is self-managed: The working group will vote (50%+1) to approve or deny new members.
- The working group will directly vote on new Chair/Co-Chair (50%+1).
- The Chair / Co-Chair will be responsible for coordinating the group, scheduling meetings, renewing the group’s membership, and ensuring that the group’s activities align with its scope and responsibilities.

## Budget

The group has no dedicated budget, and does not manage funds on behalf of the DSF.

## Comms

- Group coordination will occur via a new #events-support channel on the DSF Slack.
- Coordination with other groups and teams, and external relations via a DSF-provided contact email: (events-support at djangoproject dot com).
- Regular synchronous meetings will take place via video conferencing monthly.

## Reporting

The working group will provide quarterly written reports to the DSF board, outlining ongoing activities, progress, challenges, and recommendations. Additionally, critical updates related to DjangoCon events will be communicated in real-time to the board as necessary.
