# AI research working group

The Artificial Intelligence working group researches opportunities and challenges that come from adoption of Artificial Intelligence by Django users and developers.

## Scope of responsibilities

The group is a one-off research project of four months to scope any future work relating to AI. Within this one-off project, the group does coordinated research with AI enthusiasts and skeptics who want to support the Django project and community in navigating the impact of AI. We consider in particular impacts in areas relating to the Django Software Foundation’s goals:

> - Support development of Django by sponsoring sprints, meetups, gatherings and community events.
> - Promote the use of Django among the World Wide Web development community.
> - Protect the intellectual property and the framework's long-term viability.
> - Advance the state of the art in Web development.

This coordinated research activity will involve:

- Discussions with other [teams and working groups](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/teams/).
- Surveying or otherwise gathering input from the wider Django community.
- Desk research on specific topics of interest, determined by the group based on community input.
- Producing reports and recommendations for the DSF Board, Steering Council, and wider community.

We expect to report on three specific areas where AI is likely to have a significant impact on Django and its community:

- Building AI/ML products with Django
- Improvements to AI coding capabilities for developers
- Considering how AI tools can be used and mis-used for Django core and in the Django ecosystem

We want in particular to explore AI usage that is broadly compatible with the Django’s community existing values and principles (meeting standards of social responsibility, sustainability, safety, ethics).

Many of these activities can be undertaken by any contributor. The AI working group coordinates this work, to produce research that has a broader coverage and ultimately a broader impact than individual contributors could achieve.

## Future membership

As a time-boxed research project, we expect to be looking for a high number of contributors soon after the group is formed: 20-30. We will then only recruit more members for specific roles fundamental to the group’s success (facilitators, researchers with specific expertise, analysts, writers).

If you are interested in joining, please use our form: [Apply to join the AI working group](https://forms.gle/s6xUcaZ17QHQfhxJA).

Priority will be given to volunteers who:

- Have expertise with AI.
- Have a record of contributing to Django.

Members may leave at any time.

Members can also be removed by:

- Becoming disqualified by the Code of Conduct working group
- A vote of the Steering Council
- The vote of a 50% + 1 majority of the rest of the group

## Budget

No budget is required at this time.

## Communication channels

The AI working group operates in several areas:

- Public #ai channel on [Django Discord server](https://chat.djangoproject.com/)
- TBC Forum category
- Private channel on [Django Discord server](https://chat.djangoproject.com/) or on the DSF Slack workspace
- A private Google Drive folder and Group in the DSF Google workspace

The AI working group can be tagged specifically in the following areas:

- `@django/ai` in the Django organization
- Other options TBC

The group meets online once per month.

## Reporting

The group posts public meeting notes to the forum.

At the conclusion of its four-month term, the group will release a final report that is shared with the Django community.
