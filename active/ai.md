# AI Team

The Artificial Intelligence Team encourages thoughtful adoption of Artificial Intelligence by Django users and developers.

## Scope of responsibilities

The scope of the AI Team includes:

- Supporting AI adoption by Django users to create AI/ML products
- Improvements to AI coding capabilities for developers
- Considering how AI tools can be used for Django core

We encourage experimentation, and responsible use of AI (ethics, safety features, guardrails, carbon footprint).

---

The scope of the AI Team is expected to change over time, and is to be decided by consensus of the team, with input from the Steering Council as required.

\[TBC&nbsp; - could add examples of how the scope could evolve?\]

Many of these activities can be undertaken by any contributor. The AI Team coordinates this work. It can step in where contributors are not available and support those who lack the knowledge to do so themselves.&nbsp;

### Alumni

## Future membership

The team does not have a fixed size. The team decides when new members are needed. New members are chosen from a list of volunteers. If there are no qualified volunteers the team will place an advertisement on the Django website.

Priority will be given to volunteers who:

- Have expertise with AI.
- Have a record of contributing to Django.

Members must opt-in to remain on the team on an annual basis. They may also leave for any reason.

Members can also be removed by:

- Becoming disqualified by the Code of Conduct working group
- A vote of the Steering Council
- The vote of a 50% + 1 majority of the rest of the AI Team

## Budget

No budget is required at this time. This will be reviewed at least annually. Any changes to the budget may be requested from the board.

## Communication channels

The AI team operates in several areas:

- Public #ai channel on [Django Discord server](https://chat.djangoproject.com/)
- TBC Forum category
- Private #ai-team channel on [Django Discord server](https://chat.djangoproject.com/)
- A private Google Drive folder and Group in the DSF Google workspace

The AI team can be tagged specifically in the following areas:

- [@django/ai](https://github.com/orgs/django/teams/ai) team in the Django organization
- ?

The team meets online once per month.

## Reporting

The team posts public meeting notes to the forum. These serve as reports to the DSF Board and Steering Council.

The team produces an annual report that is shared with the Django community.
