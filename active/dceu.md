The DjangoCon Europe Support working group supports prospective and current organizers in the following ways:

- Provide a point of contact for people interested in organizing the conference to ask questions
- Provide advice to selected DjangoCon Europe organizers and assist them in staying on track by proactively keeping in touch with them during the process of organizing
- Debrief with organizers after the event
- Collect resources resources (documentation, budget, contacts, ...) and lessons learned that make continuity between conferences easier and provide these to future and current organizers

The DjangoCon Europe Support working group supports the DSF board in the following ways:

- Provide advice and assitance on creating and executing the Call for Proposal process for future conferences
- Assist the board in vetting incoming proposals and make recommendations for how to approach the decision (the final decision is always made by a board vote)

## Future membership

Membership is open to former organizers of DjangoCon Europe. Questions about membership can be directed to european-organizers-support@djangoproject.com. [Contact the board](https://www.djangoproject.com/contact/foundation/) to express interest.

Membership is self-managed: new members may self-nominate; the WG will vote (50%+1) to approve/deny new members; the WG will directly vote on new Chair/Co-Chairs.

## Budget

No budget needed at this time.

## Comms

The team internally operates via a Google Group. This is also the primary external point of contact to reach the working group: european-organizers-support@djangoproject.com

The working group uses the #europe channel on DSF's Slack to coordinate internally, with the DSF board and with other DSF working groups.

The team will also set up a collection of data and information, in something like a Google Drive folder. A static informational website might follow at a later date.

## Reporting

As DjangoCon Europe has a native yearly cycle, the working group will formally report to the board once per year. However, since the working group is not making any decisions and does most of its work by advising the board, the board is expected to be updated on important DjangoCon Europe matters in real-time througout the year.
