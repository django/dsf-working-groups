# Online Community Working Group

## Scope of responsibilities

This group exists to support the official community platforms and those in elevated roles on those platforms.

The [Django Forum](https://forum.djangoproject.com/) and the [Django Discord](https://discord.gg/xcRH6mN4fa) are core parts of the overall community and those that help and moderate these platforms take significant time from their day to help others.
We can support them through training and taking action to make their lives easier.

The broad goals of the group are:
  - facilitate and centralise discussion between moderators and admins on the various platforms
  - coordinate efforts for training and processes around moderation
  - provide support to improve the platforms to lighten moderation and admin workloads
  - provide training and support to the wider community on how to use the platforms effectively
  - ensure consistency that our online Django communities are welcoming and safe spaces

- What actions are you proposing the WG be allowed to take directly?
  - Creation and management of processes related to community platforms.
    - Adding/removing moderators & other roles
    - Training for moderators
    - Ensuring moderation is consistent across teams and platforms
  - Taking ideas from the community to improve the community spaces.
- Which actions will the WG take back to the Board for votes?
  - Moving platforms if required
  - Budget to improve existing platforms

There is a lot of potential ideas in this space. Part of the WG will be setting up a process to take ideas and have a backlog of these ideas.
