# WG Charter Template

## Scope of responsibilities

This group exists to support the official community platforms and those in elevated roles on those platforms.

The Forum and the Discord are core parts of the overall community and those that help and moderate these platforms take significant time from their day to help others. We can support them through training and taking action to make their lives easier.

The broad goals of the group are:
  - facilitate and centralise discussion between moderators and admins on the various platforms
  - coordinate efforts for training and processes around moderation
  - provide support to improve the platforms to lighten moderation and admin workloads
  - provide training and support to the wider community on how to use the platforms effectively

- What actions are you proposing the WG be allowed to take directly?
  - Creation and management of processes related to community platforms.
    - Adding/removing moderators & other roles
    - Training for moderators
    - Ensuring moderation is consistent across teams and platforms
  - Taking ideas from the community to improve the community spaces.
- Which actions will the WG take back to the Board for votes?
  - Moving platforms if required
  - Budget to improve existing platforms

There is a lot of potential ideas in this space. Part of the WG will be setting up a process to take ideas and have a backlog of these ideas.

### Delegated responsibilities

With regards to Django Software Foundation responsibilities and resources, the group operates with:

- I'm unsure what power's might be delegated, if any. Board members would need to input into this.
- Admin privileges to members of the forum & Discord or existing admin representive joining as a member.

## Initial membership

- Chair: TBD
- Co-Chair: TBD
- Board Liaison (must be an active Board member; may be the same as Chair/Co-Chair): TBD
- Other members:
  - Andrew Miller

## Future membership

Answer the following questions here:

- Who is eligible to join? Any volunteer, or are there specific requirements?
  - At least a DSF member, ideally already holding an elevated role in the forum or Discord (or other community group)
- How do people who want to join sign up / volunteer / express interest?
  - Message of the existing group
- How will decisions on adding/removing members be handled?
  - Direct membership: new members may self-nominate; the WG will vote (50%+1) to approve/deny new members; the WG will directly vote on new Chair/Co-Chairs.


## Budget

- How much money or spending discretion do you need?
  - None to begin with, however I would expect over time budget to get allocated for supporting the Forum and Discord  server.
- How do you want that money allocated:
  - None to begin with.

## Comms

Where will discussions and activities take place?

Suggestions:

- Private Channel in the Discord Server and private category in the forum.
- This space should be shared with the CoC Commitee or another space for shared comms across platforms.

Meetings: Monthly video call meeting on Discord.

## Reporting

How and how often will the WG report back to the board?
  - Monthly forum post and discord announcement of improvements made to the platforms.
