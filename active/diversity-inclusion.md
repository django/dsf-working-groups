# Diversity & Inclusion Working Group 

## Scope of responsibilities

The working group's purpose is to support the DSF in supporting and facilitating the growth of a diverse and international community of Django programmers, and especially to make sure that the voices of Underrepresented groups are heard in order to foster a more inclusive and diverse Django community.
Our primary goal is to increase participation from underrepresented groups, create an inclusive community environment, and promote diverse leadership within the Django project. We also aim to provide guidance to the DSF Board of Directors in line with this mandate. 
The Working Group will pursue this goal in several ways including:

- Recruiting globally representative Working Group members that will advocate for and provide insights on behalf of their local communities. Our members will, where possible, include representatives from each continent/ region.
- Discussing policy, initiatives, grant proposals and membership to recommend to the DSF Board of Directors in line with the group’s purpose.
- Communicating and collecting feedback from the Django community to understand how the DSF can better serve and grow a diverse membership.
- Measuring, evaluating, and sharing the DSF’s progress towards its diversity initiatives on a regular basis.
- The Working Group reserves the right to consult with outside experts.

- Performing Audit or report on D&I of Django events and contributors.
