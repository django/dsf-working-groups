# Accessibility Team

This charter supersedes [DEP 11: Accessibility Team](https://github.com/django/deps/blob/main/final/0011-accessibility-team.rst).
The Accessibility Team encourages projects maintained by the Django Software
Foundation to be accessible to as many people as possible.
We focus on those with disabilities who find it more challenging to use the web.


## Scope of responsibilities

The scope of the Accessibility Team includes all projects maintained by
the Django Software Foundation.

This includes but is not limited to:

- User-facing parts of Django, such as:
  -  default HTML output in forms
  -  the Django admin and its default theme, HTML, and UI components.
- All websites and other software projects maintained by the DSF, such as:
  -  the Django website
  -  the documentation
  -  Django Snippets
  -  the issue tracker

The scope also includes Django events and other community projects where accessibility
is a relevant concern.

The responsibilities of the Accessibility Team are expected to change over time,
and are to be decided by consensus of the team, with input from the Steering Council
as required. These include:

- Deciding on any accessibility guidelines to follow, such as WCAG.
- Implementing automated testing to find issues.
- Coordinating accessibility audits.
- Coordinating the fixing of accessibility issues and accessibility improvements.
- Writing and maintaining documentation relating to accessibility. For example:
  - a statement of commitment to accessibility issues
  - contribution guidelines
- Reviewing code that affects the accessibility of any in-scope projects.

Many of these duties can be undertaken by any contributor. The Accessibility Team
coordinates this work.
It can step in where contributors are not available and support those who lack the
knowledge to do so themselves.
Accessibility Team members are added to a team in the GitHub organization with
read access to relevant repositories. With this they can be requested to review pull
requests.

They may also leave for any reason.

Members can also be removed by:

## Reporting

The team produces an annual report that is shared with the Django community.
