## Comms

- Collaborative documents

## Reporting

The Fundraising Working Group is required to submit regular reports on fundraising efforts. 

Frequency: at least quarterly, with a strong preference for some sort of live "dashboard" (read: Google Sheet) that's updated more regularly for the Board to check any time. 

The specifics of what needs to be in the report will change over time and should be an ongoing conversation between the Fundraising Working Group and the Board. It can and should change and evolve over time. It should probably should include things like documentation of its operations and fundraising efforts and strategy, anticipated next steps on funding opportunities, planned interactions with major donor leads, updates of other activities the group is working on, etc.

The Fundraising Working Group is also expected to report any meta-issues or problems to the board. E.g. ongoing strategic questions without answers, problems with DSF infrastructure, emerging issues, and so forth.
