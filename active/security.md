- Report triagers: These team members are responsible for acknowleding and triaging reports initially to determine likelyhood of security concern and severity.
 
## Future membership

The team does not have a fixed size. The team decides when new members are needed. New members are chosen from a list of volunteers. If there are no qualified volunteers the team will place an advertisement on the Django website.

Members must opt-in to remain on the team on an annual basis. They may also leave for any reason.

Members can also be removed by:

- Becoming disqualified by the Code of Conduct working group
- A vote of the Steering Council
- The full consensus of the rest of the Security Team

### Membership requirements

Members should possess some  knowledge of the following topics, but not necessarily all of them.

- Building Django applications
- Contributing to Django
- Web applications
- Web security
- Software security

### How to join

Any person can volunteer to join the security team by submitting a Google Form (TODO: Create link). The team/WG will vote (50%+1) to approve/deny new members; the team/WG will directly vote on new Chair/Co-Chairs.

The application should include the following:

- Why do you want to join the team?
- What is your history of using Django as a developer?
- What is your history of contributing to Django?
- What security experience do you bring that would be helpful to the team?

(TODO: Define cadence of reviewing applications)

## Budget

No budget is required at this time. This will be reviewed at least annually.
Any changes to the budget may be requested from the board.

## Comms

The team has discussions in two places:

1. Formal and sensitive discussions on the mailing list: security@djangoproject.com
2. Informal and team discussions on the DSF Slack in the private channel `#security-team`

## Reporting

The team has two responsibilities in regards to reporting to the Board and the Steering Council:

1. Use [Django Release Announcements thread](https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/django-release-announcements/655/96) on the Forum to report security releases
2. An annual report summarizing the team's activity, areas of concern, considerations for the future and any other relevant topics
