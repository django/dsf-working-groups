# Accessibility Team

This charter supersedes [DEP 11: Accessibility Team](https://github.com/django/deps/blob/main/final/0011-accessibility-team.rst).
The Accessibility Team encourages projects maintained by the Django Software
Foundation to be accessible to as many people as possible.
We focus on those with disabilities who find it more challenging to use the web.


## Scope of responsibilities

The scope of the Accessibility Team includes all projects maintained by
the Django Software Foundation.

This includes but is not limited to:

- User-facing parts of Django, such as:
  -  default HTML output in forms
  -  the Django admin and its default theme, HTML, and UI components.
- All websites and other software projects maintained by the DSF, such as:
  -  the Django website
  -  the documentation
  -  Django Snippets
  -  the issue tracker

The scope also includes Django events and other community projects where accessibility
is a relevant concern.

The responsibilities of the Accessibility Team are expected to change over time,
and are to be decided by consensus of the team, with input from the Steering Council
as required. These include:

- Deciding on any relevant accessibility guidelines to follow, such as WCAG,
  and at which conformance level.
- Implementing automated testing to catch issues, working with the ops
  team as needed to integrate this into CI processes.
- Coordinating accessibility audits on all relevant projects.
- Coordinating the fixing of accessibility issues and accessibility improvements
- Writing and maintaining documentation relating to accessibility, such as
  a statement of commitment to accessibility issues, and contribution
  guidelines.
- Reviewing accessibility fixes, improvements and other tickets that may affect
  accessibility of any relevant project.

Many of these duties can be undertaken by any contributor, not only by the
Accessibility Team, however the Accessibility Team coordinates this work
and can step in where contributors are not available and support those who lack the
knowledge to do so themselves.
Accessibility Team members are added to a team in the GitHub organization with
read access to relevant repositories, so that they may be requested to review pull
requests, at the discretion of the author, reviewer, or other party.

## Future membership

The team does not have a fixed size, but instead will grow and shrink
organically as members choose to leave, and when new members are deemed to be
required by the rest of the team.
New members shall be chosen from a list of volunteers, or if there is a lack
of volunteers, an advertisement will be published on the Django website.
Priority will be given to volunteers who, in no particular order:

- Have disabilities that make using the web and/or web development more
  difficult.
- Have relevant contributions or expertise in the field.
- Have a record of contributing to Django.

Members must opt-in to remain on the team on an annual basis. They may also leave
on their own volition at any time and for any reason. Membership can also be
terminated by:

- Becoming disqualified due to actions taken by the Code of Conduct working group
- A vote of the Steering Council
- The full consensus of the rest of the Accessibility Team


## Budget

No budget is required at this time. This will be reviewed at least annually.
Any changes to the budget must be approved by the board.


## Communication channels

The Accessibility team operates in several areas:
- [Accessibility Forum category](https://forum.djangoproject.com/c/internals/accessibility/26)
- Public #accessbility channel on [Django Discord server](https://chat.djangoproject.com)
- Private channel on [Django Discord server](https://chat.djangoproject.com)
- A private Google Drive folder and Group in the DSF Google workspace

The Accessibility team can be tagged specifically in the following areas:

- The [@accessibility](https://forum.djangoproject.com/groups/accessibility) Forum group tag
- As a [GitHub team](https://github.com/orgs/django/teams/accessibility) in the Django organization

The team meets online once per month.


## Reporting

The team posts [public meeting notes](https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/accessibility-team-meeting-notes/26133)
to the forum. These serve as reports to the DSF Board and Steering Council.

The team produces an annual report that is shared with the Django community.
