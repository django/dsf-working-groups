# Technical Team/WG Charter Template

_This is a template charter for a technical team / working group. You'll need all the following for a proposal to be considered complete. See the [README](README.md) for more information on each field._

## Scope of responsibilities

Write a paragraph or a few bullet points describing the WG here.
Please link any relevant documentation.

- What powers are you asking the board to delegate to you, if any?
- What powers are you asking the Steering Council to delegate to you, if any?
- What actions are you proposing the team/WG be allowed to take directly?
- Which actions will the team/WG take back to the Board for votes, if any?
- Which actions will the team/WG take back to the Steering Council for votes, if any?

## Initial membership

- Chair:
- Co-Chair:
- [Optional] Board Liaison (must be an active Board member; may be the same as Chair/Co-Chair):
- [Optional] Steering Council Liaison (must be an active Steering Council member; may be the same as Chair/Co-Chair):
- Other members:

## Future membership

Answer the following questions here:

- Who is eligible to join? Any volunteer, or are there specific requirements?
- How do people who want to join sign up / volunteer / express interest?
- How will decisions on adding/removing members be handled?

For the last question, we suggest picking one of the following:

- Direct membership: new members may self-nominate; the team/WG will vote (50%+1) to approve/deny new members; the team/WG will directly vote on new Chair/Co-Chairs. (This is the appropriate model for most team/WGs).
- Board-managed: new members may self-nominate, but must be voted in by the Board. The Board must approve changes to the Chair/Co-Chair. (This is the appropriate model for sensitive, community based teams/WGs, such as the Ops Team, or WGs with large budgets ($thousands/year).)
- Steering Council-managed: new members may self-nominate, but must be voted in by the Steering Council. The Steering Council must approve changes to the Chair/Co-Chair. (This is the appropriate model for sensitive teams/WGs, such as the Mergers team.)

## Budget

- How much money or spending discretion do you need?
- How do you want that money allocated -- e.g. once yearly, quarterly, etc.

## Comms

Where will discussions and activities take place?

Suggestions:

- A mailing list that we'll create, `some-wg@djangoproject.com`
- The DSF Slack
- The Django Discord server
- The Forum

Meetings: we also suggest synchronous meetings via Meet/Zoom/Whereby/etc at least monthly.

## Reporting

How and how often will the team/WG report back to the Steering Council and/or board?

Suggestion: we'll post a report to the Forum [monthly/every two months/every quarter].
