# WG Charter Template

_This is a template charter for a working group. You'll need all the following for a proposal to be considered complete. See the [README](README.md) for more information on each field._

## Scope of responsibilities

Write a paragraph or a few bullet points describing the WG here.

- What powers are you asking the board to delegate to you?
- What actions are you proposing the WG be allowed to take directly?
- Which actions will the WG take back to the Board for votes?

## Initial membership

- Chair:
- Co-Chair:
- Board Liaison (must be an active Board member; may be the same as Chair/Co-Chair):
- Other members:

## Future membership

Answer the following questions here:

- Who is eligible to join? Any volunteer, or are there specific requirements?
- How do people who want to join sign up / volunteer / express interest?
- How will decisions on adding/removing members be handled?

For the last question, we suggest picking one of the following:

- Direct membership: new members may self-nominate; the WG will vote (50%+1) to approve/deny new members; the WG will directly vote on new Chair/Co-Chairs. (This is the appropriate model for most WGs).
- Board-managed: new members may self-nominate, but must be voted in by the Board. The Board must approve changes to the Chair/Co-Chair. (This is the appropriate model for sensitive WGs, such as the Conduct WG, or WGs with large budgets ($thousands/year).)

## Budget

- How much money or spending discretion do you need?
- How do you want that money allocated -- e.g. once yearly, quarterly, etc.

## Comms

Where will discussions and activities take place?

Suggestions:

- A mailing list that we'll create, `some-wg@djangoproject.com`
- The DSF Slack

Meetings: we also suggest synchronous meetings via Meet/Zoom/Whereby/etc at least monthly.

## Reporting

How and how often will the WG report back to the board?

Suggestion: we'll email a written report to the board [monthly/every two months/every quarter].
